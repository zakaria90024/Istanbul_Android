    <string name="details_flag">The flag of Turkey, officially the Turkish flag[2] (Turkish: Türk bayrağı) is a red flag featuring a white star and crescent.
        \n\nThe flag is often called al bayrak (the red flag), and is referred to as al sancak (the red banner) in the Turkish national anthem.
        The current design of the Turkish flag is directly derived from the late Ottoman flag, which had been adopted in the late 18th century and acquired its final form in 1844.
        \n\nThe measures, geometric proportions, and exact tone of red of the flag of Turkey were legally standardized with the Turkish Flag Law on 29 May 1936.[3] </string>
